        <div class="intro">The computer has randomly chosen a number between 1 to 100. Your mission is to guess this number! Type your guess into the input box and click the "Check" button to see if you’re correct. If your guess is too high or too low, you'll receive a hint to guide your next attempt. If you guess the number correctly, you'll see a victory message and the game will end.</div>
